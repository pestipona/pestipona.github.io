# Creating your Own Personal Web Page in GitHub:
There are three parts to creating your own personal web page in GitHub. The first page is creating a GitHub account, the second is downloading, installing, and creating a project in VS Code, and the third part is creating your repository in GitHub.

## I. Creating a GitHub account:
1. Go to GitHub (Links to an external site.) and select "Sign Up" (Links to an external site.)
2. Follow through the instructions like entering your email address, password, username, and confirm you are not a bot.
3. Install all extensions needed
4. After creating your GitHub account sign in with your credentials.

## II. Create your first project in VS Code
1. If you don't have VS Code download and install VS Code (Links to an external site.)
2. Go through the installation process and create your user account.
3. Create a folder in your directory for the project and open it in VS Code.
4. Go to File > "New Text File" > HTML
5. Enter the following code for the web page and save it as index.html
```html
<html>
    <h1>Username Portfolio</h1>
    <img src="path to image file">
</html>
```
6. Replace your Username with your actual username from GitHub and the path to your picture. Make sure the image file is stored in the same directory as the index.html file

## III. Create your repository on GitHub
1. In your GitHub account click on the "+" sign at the top right corner
2. be sure to name your repository as "username.github.io" again substituting the username with your actual one
3. After your first repository is created click on the drop-down arrow "Add file"
4. This would open up a page and you can just drag and drop your index.html and image file to the page.
5. Hit "commit" this will save both files to your remote repository on GitHub
6. Now you can open a new tab in your browser and enter the exact URL of "username.github.io"
7. This will display your first personal web page on GitHub. Congratulations!
